## Problem Statement: Quality Education

> "The beautiful thing about Education is nobody can take it away from you."

Education has always been a heated topic in India. The quest for world-class quality education has remained a significant challenge. While multiple organizations claim to provide the best learning experiences, gaps persist in ensuring holistic and interactive education. Issues such as limited student interaction, inadequate parent-teacher meeting sessions, lack of monitoring tools, and scattered educational resources have left much to be desired.

To address these challenges, we introduce **Adhayan**, "The best E-learning platform for the student, by the student, of the student." 

## About Adhayan
Adhayan is a comprehensive E-learning platform that provides a one-stop solution for students to:
- Evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.
- Access study materials and live lectures.
- Resolve doubts and engage in interactive chat rooms.
- Facilitate seamless parent-teacher interactions.
- Access daily motivational resources.

The availability of all these features on a single platform ensures better educational growth and holistic development for learners.
